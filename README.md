# X-Ray Diffraction (NaCl Crystal)

## Objective
To verify Bragg’s Law using NaCl crystal diffraction and determine lattice spacing.

## Method
- X-rays of known wavelength were diffracted through a NaCl crystal.
- Angles of diffraction were measured using a goniometer.
- Bragg’s Law:
  \[
  n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta)
  \]
  used to compute \( d \).

## Analysis
Peaks were fit using Gaussian fits in `LT.box`, and the lattice spacing was computed for various orders.

## Results
- Lattice spacing \( d = (2.81 ± 0.03) \, Å \)
- Matches tabulated value for NaCl.

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrated wave–crystal interaction.
- Practiced Gaussian fitting and calibration.
